## Neural Machine Translation For Indian Languages

This was a semester long assignment for the course **CS779** - offered in the Odd-Semester 2023-24 by [Prof. Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/). 

The `phase1` holds the content (a `.ipynb` file explaining the progress for an instance of Bengali Language) for the former half of the assignment. The `.pdf` file holds the detailed accounts of the task of translating English to Indic languages.

The `phase2` holds the content (a `.ipynb` file explaining the evaluation of certain languages on trained models) for the latter half of the assignment. The `.pdf` file holds the detailed accounts of the task of translating Indic languages to English.

Open this Google Drive link to find how the assignment progressed and find the trained models as well (iter5 onwards are the second half of the assignement, also find the dataset withing the drive) [[link]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fLdLblg8XW2ckF5A1s58nbLEqGTJcKwS?usp=sharing)

The Google Drive is poorly managed (as it had just acted as a dump yard when the course progressed), however it gives a perspective of evolving towards better mechanisms of translation!
